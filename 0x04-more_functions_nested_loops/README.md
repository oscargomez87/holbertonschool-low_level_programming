* **1-isdigit.c**: Checks for a digit (0 through 9), returns 1 if is a digit and o otherwise.
* **2-mul.c**: Multiplies two integers.
* **3-print_numbers.c**: Prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
* **4-print_most_numbers.c**: Prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line, does not print 2 and 4.
* **5-more_numbers.c**: Prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
* **6-print_line.c**: Draws a straight line in the terminal, requires the number of times it should be printed, the line will end with a \n and if the number if times is 0 or less, the function will only print \n.
* **7-print_diagonal.c**: Draws a diagonal line on the terminal, requires the number of times it should be printed, the diagonal should end with a \n and if the number if times is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n.
* **8-print_square.c**: Prints a square, followed by a new line. requires the size, if size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line, uses the character # to print the square.
* **9-fizz_buzz.c**: Prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
* **10-print_triangle.c**: Prints a triangle, followed by a new line, requires the size, if size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line.
